My Book
=======

Created for WPI CS 3014 - Human Computer Interaction

The assignment was to create a sign up interface for a nonexistant 
social network called 'My Book'. We chose to take an alternative 
approach to the problem by creating an interface that separates required 
information gathering into separate slides. At the end of the sequence, 
the user can review her/his information and make sure it is correct. If 
a correction needs to be made, the user can return to the relevant slide 
and change the information.

To get a better idea of what it's like, try it yourself:

Just click the "Sign up" button and begin.

This won the in class competition for the best project.

Authors are myself and Andrew Iovanna
